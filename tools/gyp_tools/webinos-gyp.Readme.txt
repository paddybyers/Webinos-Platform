webinos-gyp is a utility that helps the node module’s project generation.
webinos-gyp requires the "NODE_ROOT" enviroment variable to point to the node's source directory (the one that contains the src, deps and tools folders). 
Usage
-----
The same usage on all systems:
  webinos-gyp [gyp-filename] [make]
    gyp-filename: is the gyp file that will be processed (it must have a .gyp extension)
    make: this is a command that dictates webinos-gyp to build the module using visual studio’s msbuild
