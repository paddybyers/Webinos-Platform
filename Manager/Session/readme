The Session manager shall create TLS sessions between PZP and PZH using the pre-shared certificates.

We will use the standard node.js libraries to establish TLS sessions and get access to certificate stores.

To build code included, please first run node-waf configure and then node-waf build, to get compiled. Then code generated will be used in javascript.
