The Widget manager must be able to

securely store a wgt file
process a wgt file accordign to W3C + webinos rules and validate certificates
process feature elements and warp elements - passing infromation to WRT and the policy manager as required
process "service" elemental on the manifest
recieve messages bound for this application, passing to the service element as required
deal with the nested widget concepts
The core manager should be wrapped in node.js functions. However, we may decide to reuse exising C code - and integrate via node.js native extensions
