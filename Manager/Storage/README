PZP Storage

Code
----

This is a VERY early example of what we could do for encrypted storage.

It won't work on systems which don't have a "zip" and "unzip" executable, and it relies on being passed relative paths at the moment.

To use it, call "open", then access files as normal in the directory you used as an argument.  When you are finished, call "close".

More documentation on redmine.


Tests
-----

There are two tests in the "testing" directory, plus a load of other files.  These tests work under Linux.

Testing proceedure:

1) Go into the "testing" directory
2) run "node storagetest.js"
  - press any key when it stops

example output:

No error from open
Storing a key value
Getting a key value
{ foo: 'bar?' }

closed
graceful exit


3) run "node storagetest-proper.js"

example output:

Passed: Read file
Passed: Encryption
Passed: Decryption
Passed: Read file
Passed: unzip/zip
Passed: Open
Passed: Close 1
Done

4) Delete all zip files in the "testing" directory.  Do not delete the "test2" directory.
