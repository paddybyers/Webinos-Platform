The API manager must

host all available APIs that can be accessed either locally (WRT) or remotely (other PZPs)
must efficiently process teh local API and return resuls
must be able to process JSON RPC commands coming from the messaging manager and route them the the correct API
must be able to process Javascript commands issues locally, mapping them to the correct API
Most API will be implemented as native C/C++ code on the specific platform (be non -portable)

(we may add other implementation later - eg. Perl, Ruby etc)

C API headers should use the V8 conventions for Javscript types and map these to native C data types.

The V8 mappings should map directly via the NPAPI bridge

The JSON RPC message handler should also have a deterministic mapping to the V8 typed C APIs
