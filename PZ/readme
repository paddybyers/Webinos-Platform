A webkit codebase is preferred with implementations on several platforms

Either QT or Chromium are suggested for PC, as they have Windows, Mac and Linux variants.

The linux variant should be well suited to both STB an in car devices with minimal porting

V8 is the preferred JavaScript engine, being pre-integrated to Chromium and an option for QT

Android is more difficult. Android will require a different WRT strategy using the inbuilt webview component and NPAPI and JNIRegisterNativeMethod for plugins

Binding to the PZP should be done if possible through standard plugin architectures. Worst case is we have to hack into the JavaScript engine directly.

Todo
Identify the specific C interface that needs to be implmented across the NPAPI plugin. What is the precise interface between PZP and WRT
